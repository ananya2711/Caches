# Caches

This project aims at stimulating a Cache in a memory subsystem, which is much smaller
than the main memory but acts as a means through which the access and storage of Data in
the memory becomes efficient in relation to the time while also maintaining its correctness.
My Project simulates the L1 cache in a memory and is capable of performing the following
functions:
● Read
● Write
● Replace
● Evict
● Insertion
The simulation is dynamic and is based on the input provided by the user.Also I have
maintained a Main Memory too,which allows the seamless usage of the cache.
